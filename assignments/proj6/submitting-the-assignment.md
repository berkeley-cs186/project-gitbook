# Submitting the Assignment

## Files

You should make sure that all code you modify belongs to the .js files inside the `query/` directory.

## Gradescope

Once all of your files are prepared in your repo you can submit to Gradescope through GitHub the same way you did for [Project 0](../proj0/submitting.md#pushing-changes-to-github-classroom).

## Submitting via upload <a id="submitting-via-upload"></a>

If your GitHub account has access to many repos, the Gradescope UI might time out while trying to load which repos you have available. If you want to submit via upload, you can zip up your `query/` directory and upload that to Gradescope instead.

## Grading

* This project will be worth 5% of your overall grade in the class. 100% of your grade will come from the public tests provided to you.
