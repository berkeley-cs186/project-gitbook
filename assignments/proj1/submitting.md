# Submitting the Assignment

This project is due on **Thursday, 9/12/2024 at 11:59PM PDT (GMT-7)**.

Push your changes to your GitHub Classroom private repository and then submit through Gradescope. You may find it helpful to read through the Project 0 submission procedure again [here](../proj0/submitting.md). Alternatively you can submit your `proj1.sql` file directly \(make sure it is named `proj1.sql` or the autograder won't recognize it\).

A full list of files that you may modify are as follows:

* `proj1.sql`

## Grading

* 75% of your grade will be made up of tests released to you
* 20% will be determined by hidden tests unreleased tests that we will run on your submission after the deadline
* 5% will be determined by the correctness of your SQL syntax (see [`SQL vs. SQLite`](./sql-vs-sqlite.md#new-autograder) for more information)
* This project will be worth 5% of your overall grade in the class
