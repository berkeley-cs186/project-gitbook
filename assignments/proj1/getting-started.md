# Getting Started

## Logistics

This project is due **Thursday, 9/12/2024 at 11:59PM PDT (GMT-7)**. It is worth 5% of your overall grade in the class.

## Prerequisites

You should watch the SQL I lecture before beginning this project. Later questions will require material from the SQL II lecture.

## Fetching the released code

The GitHub Classroom link for this project is in the Project 1 release post on [Edstem](https://edstem.org/us/courses/62108/discussion/). Once your private repo is set up clone the project 1 skeleton code onto your local machine.

### Debugging Issues with GitHub Classroom

Feel free to skip this section if you don't have any issues with GitHub Classroom. If you are having issues \(i.e. the page froze or some error message appeared\), first check if you have access to your repo at `https://github.com/cs186-student/fa24-proj1-username`, replacing `username` with your GitHub username. If you have access to your repo and the starter code is there, then you can proceed as usual. 

### 404 Not Found

If you're getting a 404 not found page when trying to access your repo, make sure you've set up your repo using the GitHub Classroom link in the Project 1 release post on [Edstem](https://edstem.org/us/courses/62108/discussion/).

If you don't have access to your repo at all after following these steps, feel free to contact the course staff on Edstem.

## Required Software

### SQLite3

Check if you already have sqlite3 instead by opening a terminal and running `sqlite3 --version`. Any version at 3.8.3 or higher should be fine.

If you don't already have SQLite on your machine, the simplest way to start using it is to download a precompiled binary from the [SQLite website](http://www.sqlite.org/download.html).

#### Windows <a id="windows"></a>

1. Visit the download page linked above and navigate to the section **Precompiled Binaries for Windows**. Click on the link **sqlite-tools-win32-x86-\*.zip** to download the binary.
2. Unzip the file. There should be a `sqlite3.exe` file in the directory after extraction.
3. Navigate to the folder containing the `sqlite3.exe` file and check that the version is at least 3.8.3: `cd path/to/sqlite_folder` `./sqlite3 --version`
4. Move the `sqlite3.exe` executable into your `fa24-proj1-yourname` directory \(the same place as the `proj1.sql` file\)

#### macOS Yosemite \(10.10\), El Capitan \(10.11\), Sierra \(10.12\) <a id="macos-yosemite-10-10-el-capitan-10-11-sierra-10-12"></a>

SQLite comes pre-installed. Check that you have a version that's greater than 3.8.3 `sqlite3 --version`

#### Mac OS X Mavericks \(10.9\) or older <a id="mac-os-x-mavericks-10-9-or-older"></a>

SQLite comes pre-installed, but it is the wrong version.

1. Visit the download page linked above and navigate to the section **Precompiled Binaries for Mac OS X \(x86\)**. Click on the link **sqlite-tools-osx-x86-\*.zip** to download the binary.
2. Unzip the file. There should be a `sqlite3` file in the directory after extraction.
3. Navigate to the folder containing the `sqlite3` file and check that the version is at least 3.8.3: `cd path/to/sqlite_folder` `./sqlite3 --version`
4. Move the `sqlite3` file into your `fa24-proj1-yourname` directory \(the same place as the `proj1.sql` file\)

#### Ubuntu

Install with `sudo apt install sqlite3`

For other Linux distributions you'll need to find `sqlite3` on your appropriate package manager. Alternatively you can follow the Mac OS X \(10.9\) or older instructions substituting the Mac OS X binary for one from **Precompiled Binaries for Linux.**

### Python

You'll need a copy of Python 3.5 or higher to run the tests for this project locally. You can check if you already have an existing copy by running `python3 --version` in a terminal. If you don't already have a working copy download and install one for your appropriate platform from [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

## Download and extract the data set

Download the data set for this project from the course's Google Drive [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/1/folders/1j9eyruR1MaPa2qlL0fJCSVtcrT7FMD8A). You should get a file called `lahman.db.zip`. Unzip the `lahman.db.zip` file inside your `fa24-proj1-yourname` directory. You should now have a `lahman.db` file in your `fa24-proj1-yourname` directory \(the same place as the `proj1.sql` file\)

## Running the tests

If you followed the instructions above you should now be able to test your code. Navigate to your project directory and try using `python3 test.py`. You should get output similar to the following:

```text
FAIL q0 see diffs/q0.txt
FAIL q1i see diffs/q1i.txt
FAIL q1ii see diffs/q1ii.txt
FAIL q1iii see diffs/q1iii.txt
FAIL q1iv see diffs/q1iv.txt
FAIL q2i see diffs/q2i.txt
FAIL q2ii see diffs/q2ii.txt
FAIL q2iii see diffs/q2iii.txt
FAIL q3i see diffs/q3i.txt
FAIL q3ii see diffs/q3ii.txt
FAIL q3iii see diffs/q3iii.txt
FAIL q4i see diffs/q4i.txt
FAIL q4ii_bins_0_to_8 see diffs/q4ii_bins_0_to_8.txt
FAIL q4ii_bin_9 see diffs/q4ii_bin_9.txt
FAIL q4iii see diffs/q4iii.txt
FAIL q4iv see diffs/q4iv.txt
FAIL q4v see diffs/q4v.txt
```

If so, move on to the next section to start the project. If you see `ERROR`instead of `FAIL` create a followup on Edstem with details from your `your_output/` folder.
