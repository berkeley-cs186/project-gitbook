### Logistics

This assignment is due on 12/4. It has an extra credit component that works as follows:

- The top 10 submissions get a linearly decreasing grade starting at 1% (rank 1 gets 1%, rank 2 gets 0.9%, all the way until rank 9 that gets 0.1%)
- 0.1% of your total grade if you beat 7650 I/Os. This will be additive to your rank-achieved extra-credit.

You can use gradescope {LINK} to access the leaderboard and see the position of your submission. Your submissionâ€™s ranking is updated every time when any team submits a new gradescope submission.

### Partners

This will be an individual project, so no partners will be allowed.

### Prerequisites

This assignment requires that you have a complete and functioning implementation of Projects 2 and 3. We will be copying over the files from your Project 2 and 3 in order to complete this assignment. The easiest way to test that your Project 2 and 3 implementations are sufficient is to run the `TestContest` tests and ensure that they pass. You are free to modify the Project 2 and 3 files locally to ensure that they pass, to help you finish this Extra Credit assignment.

### Fetching the released code

The GitHub Classroom link for this project is in the Project 4 competition release post on Edstem {HYPERLINK}. Once your private repo is set up clone the Project 4 competition skeleton code onto your local machine.

### Copying over your local Projects 2 and 3

Next, as mentioned before, you will be copying over your completed Project 2 and 3 submissions in order to complete the rest of this assignment. 

1. Make sure you pull down the most recent version of your Project 2 and 3 submissions by running `git pull` in the respective repositories
2. Run the `copy_files.py` script. This script will prompt you to enter the directories for your previous projects, and copy the files over.

**Note: There will be no office hours support for this project. You may post any questions on Edstem.**
