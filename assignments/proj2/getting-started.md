# Getting Started

## Logistics

This project is due **Thursday, 2/20/2025 at 11:59PM PST (GMT-8)**. It is worth 6% of your overall grade in the class. The workload for the project is designed to be completed solo, but this semester we're allowing students to work on this project with a partner if you want to. Feel free to search for a partner [here](https://edstem.org/us/courses/70276/discussion/5999429)!

**A gentle reminder that though our projects have tight release schedules, projects don't tend to take the entire time given to complete them :)**

## Prerequisites

The disks, buffers, and files lecture covers reading from / writing to disks, the B+ tree lectures cover B+ tree operations.

## Academic Integrity Policy

“_As a member of the UC Berkeley community, I act with honesty, integrity, and respect for others._” — UC Berkeley Honor Code

**Read through the academic integrity guidelines** [**here**](https://cs186berkeley.net/integrityguidelines/)**.** We will be running plagiarism detection software on every submission against our own database of this semester's submissions, past submissions, and publicly hosted implementations on platforms such as GitHub and GitLab, followed by a thorough manual review process. Plagiarism on any assignment will result in a [non-reportable warning](https://conduct.berkeley.edu/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Academic-Misconduct-Resource-Sheet-for-Students-UPDATED.pdf) and a grade penalty based on the severity of the infraction.

As long as you follow the guidelines, there isn't anything to worry about here. While we do rely on software to find possible cases of academic dishonesty, every case is reviewed by multiple TAs who can filter out false positives.

## Fetching the released code

The GitHub Classroom link for this project is in the Project 2 release post on [Edstem](https://edstem.org/us/courses/70276/discussion/). You'll be working off a fresh copy of the RookieDB skeleton instead of reusing the one from Project 0.

### Setting up your local development environment

If you're using IntelliJ, you can follow the instructions in [Project 0](../proj0/getting-started.md#setting-up-your-local-development-environment) to set up your local environment again. Once you have your environment set up, you can head to the next section [Your Tasks](your-tasks.md) and begin working on the assignment.

## Working with a partner

Only one partner has to submit, but please make sure to add the other partner to the Gradescope submission. To share a newly created repository over GitHub, follow the instructions [here](../../common/adding-a-partner-on-github.md).

## Debugging Issues with GitHub Classroom

Feel free to skip this section if you don't have any issues with GitHub Classroom. If you are having issues \(i.e. the page froze or some error message appeared\), first check that you have access to your repo at `https://github.com/cs186-student/sp25-proj2-username`, replacing `username` with your GitHub username (or your partner's username, if applicable). If you have access to your repo with the starter code present, then you can proceed as usual. 

#### 404 Not Found

If you're getting a 404 not found page when trying to access your repo, make sure you've set up your repo using the GitHub Classroom link in the Project 2 release post on [Edstem](https://edstem.org/us/courses/70276/discussion/).

If you don't have access to your repo at all after following these steps, feel free to follow up on the Project 2 post on Edstem.
