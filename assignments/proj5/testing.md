# Testing

We strongly encourage testing your code yourself, especially after each part \(rather than all at the end\). The given tests for this project \(even more so than previous projects\) are **not** comprehensive tests: it **is** possible to write incorrect code that passes them all.

Things that you might consider testing for include: anything that we specify in the comments or in this document that a method should do that you don't see a test already testing for, and any edge cases that you can think of. Think of what valid inputs might break your code and cause it not to perform as intended, and add a test to make sure things are working.

## Running tests with coverage

To find cases that you've accounted for in your implementation but are not being covered in your tests, you can run all of the Project 5 tests [with coverage](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/code-coverage.html). Afterwards, you can navigate to your ARIESRecoveryManager file to see what parts of your code are not yet tested for.

## Cases not covered in the public tests

Here are a few cases mentioned in the spec but not tested for in the public test set:

* The checkpoint test provided checkpoints with a small number of transaction table and dirty page table entries -- enough to fit within 1 to 2 pages. Make sure your code still works even when there's a large amount of entries. If the entries aren't split up properly and too many entries are inserted into a single EndCheckpointLogRecord, your code will fail to flush the entry for exceeding the log tail size.
* For appropriate transactions after analysis/undo, make sure that transactions [have been cleaned up](https://github.com/berkeley-cs186/sp25-rookiedb/blob/master/src/test/java/edu/berkeley/cs186/database/recovery/DummyTransaction.java#L29) \(calling cleanup\(\) on a transaction should set that flag\).

And here are two common cases that your code should be prepared to handle:

* Make sure your redo logic still works without error even if there are no entries in the reconstructed dirty page table after analysis.
* Make sure your undo logic still works without error even if there are no transactions that need to be undone after analysis.

## Writing your own tests

You can use or modify any of the functions we provided in the public test set to write your own tests.

### Setup

```java
    @Before
    public void setup() throws IOException {
        testDir = tempFolder.newFolder("test-dir").getAbsolutePath();
        recoveryManager = loadRecoveryManager(testDir);
        DummyTransaction.cleanupTransactions();
        LogRecord.onRedoHandler(t -> {
        });
    }
```

The function above is run before every single test, and sets the value of the `recoveryManager` private variable to a new RecoveryManager object that operates on files in the `"test-dir"` directory \(locally this directory will be generated and likely cleaned up every time you run the test wherever JUnit is configured to create temporary directories\). The recovery manager object created will use a dummy locking system to prevent any dependencies with project 4, and 32 pages of memory in its buffer manager.

### Getting useful objects

The following variables of the RecoveryManager can be used for testing purposes:

* `bufferManager` - Useful if you want to manually run updates using records \(argument to LogRecord.redo\)
* `diskSpaceManager` - Useful if you want to manually run updates using records \(argument to LogRecord.redo\)
* `logManager` - Useful to directly append and flush logs to see how the recovery manager deals with them when rolling back. See `testAbortingEnd` for an example.
* `dirtyPageTable` - Useful to make sure that pages are getting flushed properly and that recLSN's are set correctly or check that its reconstructed properly during analysis.
* `transactionTable` - Useful to make sure that entries are created/removed properly or check that its  reconstructed properly during analysis.

### Redo checks

You may have noticed calls to `setupRedoChecks` and `finishRedoChecks`. To help with testing, every time redo is called on a LogRecord we make a [call to a provided method](https://github.com/berkeley-cs186/sp25-rookiedb/blob/master/src/main/java/edu/berkeley/cs186/database/recovery/LogRecord.java#L156). During regular operation this will just be a no-op function, but during testing we can set this to be whatever we want using [onRedoHandler](https://github.com/berkeley-cs186/sp25-rookiedb/blob/master/src/main/java/edu/berkeley/cs186/database/recovery/LogRecord.java#L225-L232).

To make it more straight forward to do a series of checks, setupRedoChecks accepts a list of functional objects that take a LogRecord as an argument. Every time redo is called, the first LogRecord in the list is removed and is called using the LogRecord that was redone. For example, in [testAbortingEnd](https://github.com/berkeley-cs186/sp25-rookiedb/blob/master/src/test/java/edu/berkeley/cs186/database/recovery/TestRecoveryManager.java#L196-L199) we use this to check that the expected CLR's are emitted and redone in the order that we anticipated. This is useful when:

* when ending an aborted transaction, rolling back changes should involve calling redo on CLRs as they are generated
* during the undo phase, rolling back changes should involve calling redo on CLRs as they are generated
