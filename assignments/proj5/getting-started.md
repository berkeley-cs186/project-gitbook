# Getting Started

## Logistics

This project is due **Thursday, 4/24/2025 at 11:59PM PDT (GMT-7)**. It is worth 8% of your overall grade in the class. The workload for the project is designed to be completed solo, but this semester we're allowing students to work on this project with a partner if you want to. Feel free to search for a partner on [this Edstem thread](https://edstem.org/us/courses/70276/discussion/5999429)!

**A gentle reminder that though our projects have tight release schedules, projects don't tend to take the entire time given to complete them :)**

## Prerequisites

You should watch all the recovery lectures before starting this project. We also highly recommend reviewing the [recovery notes](https://cs186berkeley.net/resources/static/notes/n14-Recovery.pdf).

## Academic Integrity Policy

“_As a member of the UC Berkeley community, I act with honesty, integrity, and respect for others._” — UC Berkeley Honor Code

**Read through the academic integrity guidelines** [**here**](https://cs186berkeley.net/integrityguidelines/)**.** We will be running plagiarism detection software on every submission against our own database of this semester's submissions, past submissions, and publicly hosted implementations on platforms such as GitHub and GitLab, followed by a thorough manual review process. Plagiarism on any assignment will result in a [non-reportable warning](https://conduct.berkeley.edu/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Academic-Misconduct-Resource-Sheet-for-Students-UPDATED.pdf) and a grade penalty based on the severity of the infraction.

As long as you follow the guidelines, there isn't anything to worry about here. While we do rely on software to find possible cases of academic dishonesty, every case is reviewed by multiple TAs who can filter out false positives.

## Fetching the released code

The GitHub Classroom link for this project is in the Project 5 release post on [Edstem](https://edstem.org/us/courses/70276/discussion/). Once your private repo is set up clone the Project 5 skeleton code onto your local machine.

### Setting up your local development environment

If you're using IntelliJ you can follow the instructions [in Project 0](../proj0/getting-started.md#setting-up-your-local-development-environment) in to set up your local environment again. Once you have your environment set up you can head to the next section [Your Tasks](your-tasks.md) and begin working on the assignment.

## Working with a partner

Only one partner has to submit, but please make sure to add the other partner to the Gradescope submission. If you want to share code over GitHub you can follow the instructions [here](../../common/adding-a-partner-on-github.md).

## Debugging Issues with GitHub Classroom

Feel free to skip this section if you don't have any issues with GitHub Classroom. If you are having issues \(i.e. the page froze or some error message appeared\), first check if you have access to your repo at `https://github.com/cs186-student/sp25-proj5-username`, replacing `username` with your GitHub username. If you have access to your repo and the starter code is there, then you can proceed as usual.

### 404 Not Found

If you're getting a 404 not found page when trying to access your repo, make sure you've set up your repo using the GitHub Classroom link in the Project 5 release post on [Edstem](https://edstem.org/us/courses/70276/discussion/).

If you don't have access to your repo at all after following these steps, feel free to contact the course staff on Edstem.
